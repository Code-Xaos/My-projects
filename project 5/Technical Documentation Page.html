    <p><li>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</li></p>
    <p><li>C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</li></p>

    <p><li>The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions"; and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages." C++ inherits most of C's syntax. 
      The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:</li></p>
    <p><code>#include iostream
      int main()
      {
          std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
      }</code></p>
    <p><li>Modern Hello World!</li></p>
    <p><code> #include iostream
        using namespace std;
        
        int main() 
        { 
            cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
            return 0; 
        } </code></p>

  <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
    <header class="big">Variables</header>
      <p><li>Variables are containers for storing data values.
        In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</li></p>
        <ul>
          <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
          <li>double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
          <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
          <li>string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
          <li>bool - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
        </ul>
    <p><li>Example</li></p>
    <p><code>int myNum = 15;
      cout << myNum;</code></p>
    </section>
  <section id="Basic_Data_Types" class="main-section">
    <header class="big">Basic Data Types</header>
      <p><li>A variable in C++ must be a specified data type:</li></p>
    <p><code>int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
      float myFloatNum = 5.99;     // Floating point number
      double myDoubleNum = 9.98;   // Floating point number
      char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
      bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean
      string myText = "Hello";     // String</code></p>
    <p><li>The data type specifies the size and type of information the variable will store</li></p>
    </section>
  <section id="Operators" class="main-section">
    <header class="big">Operators</header>
      <p><li>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</li></p>
    <p><code>int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
      int sum2 = sum1 - 50;      // 100 (150 - 50)
      int sum3 = sum2 * sum2;     // 1000 (100 * 100)
      int a = b / c // 2 (10/5)
      int i++ //i+1
      int i-- //i-1
    </code></p>
